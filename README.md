# Genders.WTF

A very work-in-progress project.

If you know how to use GitHub, add a new `.md` file to `gender/` with a matching
image in `img/`, and create a pull request.

If you don't know how to use GitHub, please tweet me [@ineffyble](https://twitter.com/ineffyble), as I haven't yet set up a submission system.
