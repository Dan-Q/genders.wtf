name: Select a g
alt: A screenshot of a full-screen dialog from a Nintendo Wii game, with the prompt "Select a g". The two options are "male" which looks mostly normal except for a severely stretched-out 'man' icon behind the text, and another button which is vertically stretched off the top and bottom of the screen, obscures the rest of the prompt, and is unreadable.
